# Summer of Code

**Yao** is part of [Julia's Summer of Code](https://julialang.org/soc/gsoc/science.html). Please check if you are interested
in the ideas we propose, or you can also propose your own idea to us!


## Previous Projects

### 2020

- [ZXCalculus.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/ZXCalculus.jl): [ZX-calculus](http://zxcalculus.com) is a graphical language which can characterize quantum circuits. It is a powerful tool which is usually used for quantum ciucuits simplification. `ZX.jl` will implement quantum ciucuits simplification algorithms based on ZX-calculus in pure Julia. Also, it will provide interfaces to import and export quantum circuits to the form of YaoIR, an intermediate representation for quantum programs in the [`Yao.jl`](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl). So that one can get quantum circuits with higher performance automatically when designing quantum programs with `Yao.jl`.

### 2019

- [QuDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/QuDiffEq.jl): Quantum algorithms for solving differential equations.
